# Binge+

Binge+ is a react-based web application that uses the OMDB api to help you browse movies and TV shows and select the ones that interest you to make a dedicated watchlist.

## Installation

Download the attached package and unzip it. Then run the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Usage

Once you start the app on your local server, you'd be directed to the "Add" page. This is our home page where you can search for movies and tv-shows. You can click on the results or the "info" icon beneath the posters to get more info about the movie/series.

**Add**

You can then click on the orange + icon at the bottom of your interested movie to add them to your watchlist. Once added the icon is disabled to prevent you from adding the same movie again by accident.

**My Watchlist**

Once you're done adding the interesting ones, you can click on the watch list button to check your current watch queue. You would see a checkmark when you hover over the movies' posters. You can click on it to remove the movies that you have watched.
